## Introduction

The guidelines here should be clear, easy to understand, and easy to follow.
They aim to foster a collaborative, respectful, and effective working environment.
### Assume positive intent, and bring a positive attitude and intentions.

First and foremost, assume positive intent. We are all working towards the same goal, and we are all part of the same team. We should bring a positive attitude and intentions to our work.  This work can be fun and challenging, and we should enjoy the journey.

### Respect peoples time and effort.

If someone takes the time to review your pull request (PR) or contributes to an issue, remember that theyâ€™ve invested time and effort. Show respect for this by responding thoughtfully and professionally.
